What is it?
===========

This is my submission to the 7th bacongamejam.

The bacongamejam is a 48 hour competition where teams of 1 or more create a game
using a voted on theme as a basis.

This gamejam's theme was "hungry", hence the snake remake. Given it's 48 hours,
I like to make something with simple mechanics, then give it some cute flair to finish it out.

This version of snake has an online top 10 list, and a hat store for you to deck out your snake.
